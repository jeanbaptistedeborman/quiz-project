quiz-project
============

An HTML-5 quizz with functionalities meant to evolve. 

Already built:
- The app chooses the questions randomly in a larger pool of questions
- A time-limit for each question with a javascript-controlled animation (a clock) to inform the user on the remaining time.
- A visual trail informing the user on the success/failure of the questions he already answered and the number of questions he needs to answer. 
- A css-based feedback on each answer-button informing the user of his success/failure and showing the right answer in case of bad answer. 
- A auditive feeback each time the user answers.
